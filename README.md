knife-tabcomplete
=================

Enables tab completion on some of the common knife commands. 

Assuming bash-completion is installed the script can be installed as /etc/bash_completion.d/knife 
and made available immediately by using '. /etc/bash_completion.d/knife' 

Tested with Knife version "Chef: 11.12.2"
