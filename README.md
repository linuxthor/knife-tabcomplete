knife-tabcomplete
=================

bash_completion script for Chef's knife command. 

Enables tab completion on some of the common knife commands. 

Caches some data to avoid querying the server each time.

Assuming bash-completion is installed this script can be installed as /etc/bash_completion.d/knife 
and made available immediately by using '. /etc/bash_completion.d/knife' 

Tested with Knife version "Chef: 11.12.2"
